📊 Data Exploration & Customer Profiling
Objective:
Use user demographics and transaction behavior to build customer personas.

Approach Overview:
RFM Analysis

Recency (R): Days since the user’s last transaction.

Frequency (F): Number of transactions per period.

Monetary (M): Total spend during a specified timeframe.

Customer Segmentation
Segment users based on their R, F, and M scores to uncover distinct behavioral groups (e.g., “loyal,” “at-risk,” “big spenders”).

CLV / LTV Modeling

Customer Lifetime Value (CLV or LTV): Predict future spending using historical RFM and revenue data.

Goal: Estimate how much new users are likely to spend in the next 1–2 years.

🔧 Dataset
Nearly one year of transaction records, including date, customer ID, and purchase amounts.

🚀 Pipeline Workflow
Compute RFM scores from transaction data.

Group customers into portrait segments using clustering (e.g., K‑means).

Model Customer Lifetime Value:

Aggregate historical RFM to predict future monetary contributions.

Answer: “Based on past behavior, how much will new users spend in the next 12–24 months?”

🔍 Why This Matters
Enables targeted marketing by identifying high-value or at-risk segments.

Informs budgeting and acquisition strategies by estimating future revenue from new users.

Provides a data-driven foundation for improving customer loyalty and retention.
